Built an SMS spam detection system using machine learning on a dataset of 5,574 messages. Implemented text preprocessing pipeline with TF-IDF vectorization. Trained multiple classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest) achieving 98% accuracy. Created API endpoint for real-time message classification. System successfully identified 97% of spam messages with low false positive rate.
