Implemented NVIDIA's end-to-end deep learning model for autonomous vehicle steering. Built convolutional neural network to predict steering angles from camera images. Achieved mean squared error of 0.09 on validation set. Created real-time inference pipeline for webcam input with visualization dashboard.
